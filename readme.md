## Goal: To demonstrate your working knowledge of react

**Requirements for part 1:** You must use react library, you can use any boilerplate and any supporting libraries you prefer. We also encourage using component libraries.
Normally you would be querying for data but we have provided a json file (players.json) with player data you can use.

### Part 1: Create a paginated grid in table format that can render all players with the following headers (see example)

  a. pagination should allow you to set records per page
  
  b. should have next and previous buttons
  
  c. should show you which page number you are on at any given time


| id                         | Name        | Region      |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `577a93a4e5925740e042b0bf` | `SketchNin` | `newjersey` |


### Part 2: Add ability to filter players based on either name or region in the view created in part 1

**Requirements for part 3:** Please use react router to navigate between the two views (crud operations for players created in part 3 and table view of all players created in part 1)
### Part 3: Add a view to add/update and delete players to the list.
